# ssm-instance

Creates an EC2 instance that is accessible via AWS Systems Manager Session Manager.

Ceates an IAM policy that you can attach to a role that grants users access to connect to the instance with Session Manager.

Creates a second instance with an incorrect tag, so the IAM Policy for user access should not work to access it.
